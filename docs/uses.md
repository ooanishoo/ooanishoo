# What are my weapons?

I love sharing the tools and resources that I use daily. I'm a big fan of [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)'s [uses.tech](https://uses.tech/) page. I've been inspired by his page to create my own. I'll try to keep this page updated as much as possible.

## Tech

- [React](https://react.dev/): React is more than a library, an architecture, or even an ecosystem. React is a community!
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Javascript on steroids! I love seeing `.ts` files over `.js`
- [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/): I've been playing around with NextJS 13 lately. So far, enjoying the framework. This site is built with NextJS.
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/): My default JavaScript Testing Framework.
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/): A library that encourages better testing practices.
- [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/): Cypress is a great tool for E2E testing. Bummed that it still doesn't have [TAB support](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type#Typing-tab-key-does-not-work) for accessibility testing
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Once you know the utility classes, it's the best way to write CSS.
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/): The fact that you can write actual CSS in your JavaScript is awesome. I use this at my work.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Great tool for building UI components and pages in isolation.

## Editor

If you are spending long hours looking at your editor, might as well have a good setup

- [Visual [Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)I switched to VSCode back in 2017 and has never looked back since then.
- [Night Owl editor theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl): I love this theme by [**sarah.drasner**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/sdras)**.** This has been my default theme for a while now.
- [Dank Mono font](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono): The coding typeface for aesthetes.
