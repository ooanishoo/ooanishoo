# What are my weapons?

I love discovering new tools and resources that can power my productivity. Here's a peek into the tools and technologies that I use and recommend. If you know a pro tip, I'm all ears!

## Tech

- <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank"> React</a>:
  It is more than a library, an architecture, or even an ecosystem. React is a community!
- <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank"> TypeScript</a>:
  Javascript on steroids! I love seeing `.ts` files over `.js`
- <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank"> NextJs</a>:
  I've been playing around with NextJS 13 lately. So far, enjoying the framework. This site is built with NextJS.

  My default JavaScript Testing Framework.

  A library that encourages better testing practices.
- <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank"> Cypress.io</a>:
  Cypress is a great tool for E2E testing. Bummed that it still doesn't have [TAB support](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type#Typing-tab-key-does-not-work) for accessibility testing.
- <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/" target="_blank"> Tailwind CSS</a>:
  Once you know the utility classes, it's the best way to write CSS.
- <a href="https://styled-components.com/" target="_blank"> styled-components</a>:
  The fact that you can write actual CSS in your JavaScript is awesome. I use this at my work.
- <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="_blank"> Storybook</a>:
  Great tool for building UI components and pages in isolation.

## Editor

If you are spending long hours looking at your editor, might as well have a good setup

- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"> Visual Studio Code</a>:
  I switched to VSCode back in 2017 and have never looked back since then.
- <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl" target="_blank"> Night Owl editor theme</a>:
  I love this theme. It has been my default theme for a while now.
